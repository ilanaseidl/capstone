(vs service staff that are busting their ass and getting comp’d low with the assumption there will be tips)

Just seems like institutionalized manipulation. I imagine I’m the not the only one that feels a negative jar vibe at  the POINT OF SALE. I’d think this would be an impression to avoid from the business’ customer service perspective.  You can have the balls to beg tips, but not the set to talk to management about getting a raise?

Yes, there are exceptions, but come on. I’m totally “Reservoir Dogs” on this."

117,"Read my first comment again, but slowly"
118,"I kind of like the self-contradiction here. If you knew her, you wouldn’t have never heard of her, but at the same time hearing and seeing means you did have heard of her. This is wild!"
119,"I did. You misspelled her name, and used a pun (maybe this is not called a pun but something else) if I am correct. I was pointing out the first meaning of the pun whereas you are correcting me on the second.

I just realized this presentation of yours is self-contradictory, which is interesting. No sarcasm, it really is interesting."
120,Thank you :)
121,"Ah my bad, you are right. I never read the second part of your first comment, might been edited or I just missed it somehow. Eighter way, yes I missspelled the name, had to type somewhat fast."
